Fire Incident risk classification Data Mining project


Property loss is one of the end effect of a fire incident which can be controlled by
taking preventive actions or it can be minimized by responding to the incident in a
faster and efficient way by using predictive analysis based on the available data
with variables such as incident type, incident time and date, estimated property
losses, area zip code and neighborhood. Applying these variables to the data
mining concept we can strive towards reduction in response time, property loss
and other resource based on prioritization.
